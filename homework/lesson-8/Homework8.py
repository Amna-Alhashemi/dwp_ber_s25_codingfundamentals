# Homework L8: Dictionaries ðŸ“š

#We have the list of tuples:

european_cities = [("Istanbul", [15460000, "Kebab", "Hagia Sophia"]),
                   ("Moscow", [12678079, "Borscht", "Red Square"]),
                   ("London", [8982000, "Fish and Chips", "Big Ben"]),
                   ("St. Petersburg", [5383890, "Blini", "Hermitage Museum"]),
                   ("Berlin", [3669491, "Currywurst", "Brandenburg Gate"]),
                   ("Madrid", [3348536, "Paella", "Royal Palace of Madrid"]),
                   ("Kiev", [2884000, "Borscht", "Saint Sophia's Cathedral"]),
                   ("Paris", [2140526, "Croissant", "Eiffel Tower"])]

# 1. Create an empty dictionary: `european_cities_info`
# 2. Loop over the `european_cities` and unpack each tuple

european_cities_info= {}
for city, info in european_cities:
    european_cities_info[city]= info
print(european_cities_info)

# 3. Print dictionary with the format City --> [Population, Dish, Landmark]
for city, info in european_cities_info.items():
    print(f"{city} --> {info}")

# 4. Sort the `european_cities_info` dictionary alphabetically by city (use sorted)          
for city in sorted(european_cities_info.items()):
    print(f"{city} --> {info}")


# 5. Safely print the 'Berlin' info from the `european_cities_info` dictionary
print(european_cities_info["Berlin"])

# 6. Safely print the type of 'London' from the `european_cities_info` dictionary
print(type(european_cities_info["London"]))

# 7. Safely print 'Barcelona' from the `european_cities_info` dictionary or 'Not Found'
if "Barcelona" in european_cities_info: 
    print(european_cities_info["Barcelona"])
else: 
    print("Not Found")

# 8. Add new city `("Rome", [2870500, "Pasta", "Colosseum"])`
european_cities_info["Rome"] = "[2870500, 'Pasta', 'Colosseum'"
print(european_cities_info)

# 9. Remove "Madrid" from `european_cities_info`
european_cities_info.pop("Madrid")
print(european_cities_info)

# 10. Check to see if Amsterdam is in `european_cities_info` and print whether it is there or not
if "Amsterdam" in european_cities_info:
    print("Amsterdam is in the list")
else: 
    print("Amsterdam is not in the list")

### Bonus: Create a dictionary from two lists:
#### Use the functions dict() and zip()
dishes = ["Pizza", "Sauerkraut", "Paella", "Hamburger"]
countries = ["Italy", "Germany", "Spain", "USA"]

zipped= zip(countries, dishes)
country_dishes= dict(zipped)

print(country_dishes)
